    <h1>TeamsPlus Terms of Service</h1>

    <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
    <p>“We”, “Us”, “Our” refers to TeamsPlus, the provider of this software extension and its related services.</p>
    <p>“You”, “User” refers to the person accessing or using TeamsPlus.</p>
    <p>“Service” refers to all features offered by TeamsPlus, including but not limited to encryption, theming,
        minigames, and encrypted tunnels.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Privacy and Collection</h3>
    <p>TeamsPlus does not collect or use any private user data. Passwords and sensitive data provided by users are
        hashed and stored securely in our databases using industry-standard techniques. We do not store plaintext data.
    </p>
    <p>Themes published through our platform remain the intellectual property of the creator. They will be stored
        indefinitely unless the author requests deletion.</p>

    <h3>3. Encryption Service</h3>
    <p>TeamsPlus provides end-to-end encryption to secure user communications and data. Our encryption stack uses proven
        cryptographic algorithms, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RSA (2048-bit or higher)</strong> – for secure asymmetric key exchanges;</li>
        <li><strong>RSA-PSS</strong> – for secure and tamper-resistant digital signatures;</li>
        <li><strong>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</strong> – 256-bit encryption used for encrypting message
            contents.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Keys are securely generated and stored on our servers, encrypted with a key derived from your password using
        industry-standard hashing and key derivation functions. Since we never store your plaintext password, it must be
        re-entered each time you use encryption features. Without it, we cannot access or recover your keys.</p>

    <p>TeamsPlus does <strong>not</strong> store, transmit, or process your encrypted messages unless explicitly
        required by a feature you opt into. We cannot decrypt or intercept any communication. In the event of criminal
        activity, please contact the relevant sender or recipient — we are technically and legally unable to provide
        decrypted content.</p>

    <h4>Security Assurance</h4>
    <p>Our cryptographic implementation is designed to resist tampering, brute-force attacks, and key recovery
        techniques under current practical computing capabilities. RSA with sufficient key length and AES-256 remain
        widely recognized for their resilience against modern attacks.</p>
    <p>Attempting to bypass or exploit our encryption systems is strictly prohibited and may result in legal
        consequences under applicable Canadian federal and Quebec provincial law.</p>

    <h4>Prohibited Actions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unauthorized decryption attempts or brute-force attacks;</li>
        <li>Injection or tampering with cryptographic routines or key storage mechanisms;</li>
        <li>Using the encryption service to conceal criminal activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Any such actions may be investigated and reported to Canadian authorities, including law enforcement and
        cybersecurity agencies. We will cooperate fully within the legal limits, despite our technical inability to
        access encrypted user data.</p>

    <h3>4. Minigame</h3>
    <p>All gameplay functions locally on your device. No data is transmitted to any server. While the minigame may
        resemble gambling in format, it is designed for fun only. TeamsPlus does not support or promote gambling.</p>

    <h3>5. Encrypted Tunnels</h3>
    <p>All connections to our services are secured with additional encryption over standard HTTPS (TLS). This provides
        added protection against proxies and inspection tools. Nevertheless, avoid transmitting highly sensitive data
        over public or untrusted networks.</p>

    <h3>6. Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p>You agree not to misuse or abuse the Services. Unauthorized access, hacking attempts, or exploiting
        vulnerabilities is strictly prohibited. This includes denial-of-service attacks, reverse engineering, or the
        distribution of malware via the platform.</p>

    <h3>7. Legal Jurisdiction</h3>
    <p>This agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec and the federal laws of Canada. Any disputes
        must be resolved in the courts of Quebec, Canada. Illegal use of TeamsPlus will be reported to appropriate law
        enforcement agencies.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or permanently ban access to our services for any user found violating these
        Terms or applicable laws.</p>

    <h3>8. Conditions of Use</h3>
    <p>By using TeamsPlus, you affirm that you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms;</li>
        <li>Will comply with all applicable local, provincial, and federal laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>9. Changes to Terms</h3>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of TeamsPlus after changes are made implies
        acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
    
   <p>TeamsPlus is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Microsoft. By using our Services, you acknowledge that TeamsPlus is an unofficial extension. Use of the extension in environments where third-party tools are restricted or prohibited may lead to consequences imposed by those environments or organizations. You are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with any applicable policies or terms of use.</p>
    <p>TeamsPlus is not responsible for any misuse or inappropriate use of the extension by its users. Users are solely accountable for their actions while using the Service. For concerns regarding inappropriate usage, please contact the individual user directly, as we do not have access to user data or activity logs.</p>
